# ðŸ“š Libmy

This is a repository of all the files I use to do my first year projects at Epitech.



### ðŸ§¿ Infos:

This repo is basically created for me, since I often alternate machines, and then I wanted to have a repo where I could update my files if I need to or whatever. Since at Epitech we have to help each other, I decided to put this online for you to see.

Namely that I do not intend to put only the lib that was created during the pool period, but also to add my own customs files :)

### âš  Warning:

I know you already know, but don't download the files, it's forbidden by the school. However you can use them as inspiration to make your own files and/or projects.
